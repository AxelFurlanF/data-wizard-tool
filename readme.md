# Data Wizard Deployer

This is meant to be an on-going project that's going to enable engineering teams to deploy basic ETL infra easily, without too much of a hassle.

## Roadmap

1. Add ability to deploy Airflow using Cloud Composer in your GCP cloud with just a few clicks.
2. Add ability to deploy a DAG by just filling up a form and uploading your python code. This will be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster every time the DAG should be executed.
3. Add observability and monitoring. See how much you're spending with your current infrastructure.
4. Add the ability to login using Google OAuth.
5. Add the ability to deploy dbt models and run them easily through the UI.
6. Add a data catalog deployed in a k8s cluster, and somehow make it easy to add metadata through the UI.
